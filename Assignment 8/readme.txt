Assignment 8 :

Developed a node application which does CRUD operations with the help of a database in MongoDB.
The name of the database is UserDataBase.

The apis used in this application are :

1. getAll for getting the user details in the database. (GET method)
2. create for pushing user details to the database. (POST method)
3. edit for updating user details of fullname and password but not email. (PUT method)
4. delete for deleteing the user from the database. (DELETE method)

I have used Postman to test the Crud operations in this application

The app is running on the port 8090.
